# LocalStorage-PresidentForm-JS

In this document, we are using local storage and JavaScript together. This is related to my old project that I have uploaded involving using JSON and JavaScript and to be able to fill out a form with information and do it over a specific time set through a timeout in the JavaScript document. This document is all of that, but stores all of the information for both the current cycle of votes and total votes into local storage through an object in the JavaScript. I've updated all of the proper information and styling that is needed to separate this, as well as all of the headers and Commons for but the name and date and project for each of these documents. . Please let me know what you think! In The next project I may try testing out the differences between using local storage and session storage versus cookies in the browser. Both are similar but different and are used for different purposes, as well as cookies being used for similar purposes. Using these types of storage are very powerful tools when building web-based applications and I can see the benefit from both of them.
